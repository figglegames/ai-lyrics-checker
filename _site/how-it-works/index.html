  <h1>How to Detect AI-Generated Song Lyrics</h1>

  <p><strong>AI Lyrics Checker</strong> is a simple, private tool that helps you understand whether song lyrics were more likely written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The tool looks at the way lyrics are written — how they're structured, what kinds of phrases they use, and whether the language sounds overly generic or stylized. It blends pattern recognition with custom rules to highlight traits often seen in AI-generated lyrics.</p>

  <h2>What It Looks For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Published lyrics from known songs</li>
    <li>Repetitive or vague emotional phrases</li>
    <li>Overly polished or stitched-together language</li>
    <li>Lack of personal detail or nuance</li>
    <li>Common AI-style tropes and imagery</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Uses It</h2>
  <p>This tool has been helpful for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Educators</strong> reviewing student submissions</li>
    <li><strong>Publishers</strong> vetting new lyric content</li>
    <li><strong>Songwriters and composers</strong> testing drafts</li>
    <li><strong>Legal teams</strong> and editorial reviewers checking for originality</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No lyrics are saved or stored. Results are generated instantly and intended as a helpful estimate — not a definitive verdict. Use it as a guide, not a judge.</p>
