  <h1>How AI Lyrics Checker Works</h1>

  <p>This tool analyzes the structure, phrasing, and patterns of song lyrics to assess the likelihood of whether they were written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence.</p>

  <p>The system checks for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognized published song titles</li>
    <li>Unusual or overly polished phrasing</li>
    <li>Patterns common in AI-generated text</li>
    <li>Repetitive or vague emotional language</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Lyrics submitted are <strong>not stored or shared</strong>. The analysis happens in real time and results are delivered immediately.</p>

  <p>This tool is intended for educational, creative, and professional use. It does not make definitive claims of authorship but provides a helpful linguistic analysis to guide your review.</p>
