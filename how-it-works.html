  <h1>How to Detect AI-Generated Song Lyrics</h1>

  <p><strong>AI Lyrics Checker</strong> is a simple, fast tool that analyzes lyrics to determine whether they were more likely written by a human or generated by AI.</p>

  <h2>What This Tool Does</h2>

  <h2>What It Looks For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognized published song titles (known human-written works)</li>
    <li>Unusual or overly polished phrasing</li>
    <li>Patterns commonly found in AI-generated lyrics</li>
    <li>Repetitive structure or lack of emotional nuance</li>
    <li>Known AI-style clichés and phrases</li>
  </ul>
